# Broadcast Message Broker

## Overview

The message broker (or just the "broker") is central to the gateway. The broker is responsible for sending and receiving messages between interested parties. In the case of the gateway, the interested parties are modules. This document describes the API for the message broker and what some of the threading implications are.

## Tracking Modules

The message broker implementation shall use the following structure definition to track each module that's connected to the broker:

```C
typedef struct BROKER_MODULEINFO_TAG
{
    /**
     * Handle to the module that's connected to the message broker.
     */
    MODULE_HANDLE             module;
    
    /**
     * The function dispatch table for this module.
     */
    CONST MODULE_APIS*        module_apis;
    
    /**
     * Handle to the thread on which this moduleâ€™s message processing loop is
     * running.
     */
    THREAD_HANDLE           thread;
    
    /**
     * Handle to the queue of messages to be delivered to this module.
     */
    VECTOR_HANDLE           mq;
    
    /**
     * Lock used to synchronize access to the 'mq' field.
     */
    LOCK_HANDLE             mq_lock;
    
    /**
     * A condition variable that is signaled when there are new messages.
     */
    COND_HANDLE             mq_cond;
    
    /**
     * Message publish worker will keep running while this is false.
     */
    sig_atomic_t            quit_worker;
}BROKER_MODULEINFO;
```

## Message Broker API

```C
typedef struct BROKER_HANDLE_DATA_TAG* BROKER_HANDLE;

#define BROKER_RESULT_VALUES \
    BROKER_OK, \
    BROKER_ERROR, \
    BROKER_INVALIDARG

DEFINE_ENUM(BROKER_RESULT, BROKER_RESULT_VALUES);

extern BROKER_HANDLE MESSAGE_extern BROKER_HANDLE Broker_Create(void);
extern void Broker_IncRef(BROKER_HANDLE broker);
extern void Broker_DecRef(BROKER_HANDLE broker);
extern BROKER_RESULT Broker_Publish(BROKER_HANDLE broker, MODULE_HANDLE source, MESSAGE_HANDLE message);
extern BROKER_RESULT Broker_AddModule(BROKER_HANDLE broker, const MODULE* module);
extern BROKER_RESULT Broker_RemoveModule(BROKER_HANDLE broker, const MODULE* module);
extern BROKER_RESULT Broker_AddLink(BROKER_HANDLE broker, const LINK_DATA* link);
extern BROKER_RESULT Broker_RemoveLink(BROKER_HANDLE broker, const LINK_DATA* link);
extern void Broker_Destroy(BROKER_HANDLE broker);
```

## Broker_Create
```C
BROKER_HANDLE Broker_Create(void)
```

**SRS_BCAST_BROKER_13_001: [** This API shall yield a `BROKER_HANDLE` representing the newly created message broker. This handle value shall not be equal to `NULL` when the API call is successful. **]**

**SRS_BCAST_BROKER_13_003: [** This function shall return `NULL` if an underlying API call to the platform causes an error. **]**

The message broker implementation shall use the following definition as the backing structure for the message broker handle:

```C
typedef struct BROKER_HANDLE_DATA_TAG
{
    /**
     * List of modules that are attached to this message broker. Each element in this
     * vector is an instance of BROKER_MODULEINFO.
     */
    VECTOR_HANDLE           modules;
    
    /**
     * Lock used to synchronize access to the 'modules' field.
     */
    LOCK_HANDLE             modules_lock;
}BROKER_HANDLE_DATA;
```

**SRS_BCAST_BROKER_13_067: [** `Broker_Create` shall `malloc` a new instance of `BROKER_HANDLE_DATA`. **]**

**SRS_BCAST_BROKER_13_007: [** `Broker_Create` shall initialize `BROKER_HANDLE_DATA::modules` with a valid `VECTOR_HANDLE`. **]**

**SRS_BCAST_BROKER_13_023: [** `Broker_Create` shall initialize `BROKER_HANDLE_DATA::modules_lock` with a valid `LOCK_HANDLE`. **]**

## Broker_IncRef

```C
void Broker_IncRef(BROKER_HANDLE broker);
```
Broker_Clone creates a clone of the message broker handle.

**SRS_BCAST_BROKER_13_108: [** If `broker` is `NULL` then `Broker_IncRef` shall do nothing. **]**

**SRS_BCAST_BROKER_13_109: [** Otherwise, `Broker_IncRef` shall increment the internal ref count. **]**

## module_publish_worker

```C
static void module_publish_worker(void* user_data)

**SRS_BCAST_BROKER_13_089: [** This function shall acquire the lock on `module_info->mq_lock`. **]**

**SRS_BCAST_BROKER_02_004: [** If acquiring the lock fails, then module_publish_worker shall return. **]**

**SRS_BCAST_BROKER_13_068: [** This function shall run a loop that keeps running while `module_info->quit_worker` is equal to `0`. **]**

**SRS_BCAST_BROKER_04_001: [** This function shall immediately start processing messages when `module->mq` is not empty without waiting on `module->mq_cond`. **]**

**SRS_BCAST_BROKER_13_071: [** For every iteration of the loop the function will first wait on `module_info->mq_cond` using `module_info->mq_lock` as the corresponding mutex to be used by the condition variable. **]**

**SRS_BCAST_BROKER_13_090: [** When `module_info->mq_cond` has been signaled this function shall kick off another loop predicated on `module_info->quit_worker` being equal to `0` and `module_info->mq` not being empty. This thread has the lock on `module_info->mq_lock` at this point. **]**

**SRS_BCAST_BROKER_13_069: [** The function shall dequeue a message from the module's message queue. **]**

**SRS_BCAST_BROKER_13_091: [** The function shall unlock `module_info->mq_lock`. **]**

**SRS_BCAST_BROKER_13_092: [** The function shall deliver the message to the module's callback function via `module_info->module_apis`. **]**

**SRS_BCAST_BROKER_13_032: [** `Broker_Publish` shall start a processing loop for every module in `BROKER_HANDLE_DATA::modules`.  **]**

**SRS_BCAST_BROKER_17_002: [** If `source` is not NULL, `Broker_Publish` shall not publish the message to the `BROKER_MODULEINFO::module` which matches `source`. **]**
